# Performance Metrics for Binary Classification Models
A library dedicated to testing the goodness of fit of a binary classification model with syntax similar to the scikit-learn library.

Fit a test to an array of predicted probabilities and an array of observed classes in order to calculate multiple metrics, including:
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
- Odds (observations of class 0 divided by observations of class 1)
- Results table for the population
